Hello, I'm Thomas, a future MSCA PhD Candidate in Battery-free Embedded AI at TU Darmstadt.

I hold a Master's-level Engineering Degree (*Diplôme d'Ingénieur*) in Industrial Engineering and a Master's degree in Mathematical Engineering, both completed in 2025. I also have three years of professional experience in the industry, where I worked on a warehouse automation project for Carrefour Supply Chain's fresh produce logistics, in France. In this role, I designed and implemented several production optimization tools, and contributed to the operational deployment of the new infrastructure.

Additionally, I completed a research internship with the Signal Analysis and Machine Intelligence group at Tampere University (TUNI) in Finland. There, I worked on enhancing a multimodal classification model and applied it to an anomaly detection problem in smart power grids.

My research at TU Darmstadt will focus on modeling the interplay between hardware capabilities and intermittent machine learning inference in embedded systems. One of the main goals will be to develop a reconfigurable dataflow architecture and a novel algorithm that optimizes key parameters of battery-free systems to enhance their efficiency. This project is part of the ANT doctoral network, which brings together 18 PhD candidates, along with multiple universities and companies.
